# DevSecOps - 2024

## How to Automate App Deployment using Portainer and Git

Automation (CI/CD) is key to efficient software delivery, but it can be tricky to get going. Portainer’s GitOps integration is the perfect place to start.

## What you will learn

You'll learn how to use Portainer (integrated into Git) to automate the deployment of apps as part of your DevOps workflow, regardless of the containerized platform or environment you’re using.

Discover how to trigger deployment updates of your apps to Docker and Kubernetes, from a Git repo via either push (your CI system tells Portainer there are changes) or pull (Portainer checks for the latest image).

In the first 10 minutes of the session Sean O’Dell, Head of Developer Relations and Marketing will provide a basic understanding of Portainer and the many benefits of GitOps automation.

In the next 45 minutes, Adolfo Delorenzo, Sales Engineering Manager, will demo some of the GitOps features within Portainer, including:
- Deploying applications with Kubernetes YAML manifest (polling and push via webhooks)
- Deploying applications with Docker Compose
- Other uses of the Git Integration
- Policy enforcement – to automatically keep apps in sync with Git.
